# APKPure Bulk Downloader

## Description

APKPure Bulk Downloader is a Python tool that allows you to download multiple Android APK packages from APKPure in parallel, using asyncio and aiohttp. The tool reads a list of package names from a file (`package_list.txt`) and automatically generates the download URLs for the latest version of each package. It includes a progress bar to visualize the download progress, and to enhance privacy, it employs random User-Agent headers for each request using the fake_useragent library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/apkpure-bulk-dl.git
```

2. Change to the repository directory:

```bash
cd apkpure-bulk-dl
```

3. Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Prepare a file named `package_list.txt` containing one package name per line, representing the APKs you want to download. (com.twitter.android)

2. Run the APKPure Bulk Downloader script:

```bash
python3 apkpure_bulk_downloader.py
```

3. The script will automatically download the APKs and save them in the current working directory with filenames matching the package names.
